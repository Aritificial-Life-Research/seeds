- Do ActionManager similar to CellManager, TopologyManager
- Do actions as list in [Experiment]

- Setup distutils stuff for distributing it

- Runs will work if Experiment:epochs not set.  Run infinitely.
    - Setup in world.  Some Actions have a problem with this, since their default end is Experiment:epochs
    - World has been updated, as has lettuce.py.  Update actions somehow.

- API to interact with a run in progress?  Sockets?
