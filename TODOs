- Remove GECCO2011Cell from main source.
- Setup distutils stuff for distributing it

- Make WellMixedTopology
  - embed the Cell and ResourceManager in the graph node first

- Runs will work if Experiment:epochs not set.  Run infinitely.
    - Setup in world.  Some Actions have a problem with this, since their default end is Experiment:epochs
    - World has been updated, as has lettuce.py.  Update actions somehow.


LATER:
- API to interact with a run in progress?  Sockets?
